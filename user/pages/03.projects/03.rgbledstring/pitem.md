# Addressable RGB LED Fairy Lights

This is a project I have worked for a long time on, always improving and increasing in scope. Even currently I have plans to move it to a new box and clean up the internal wiring and everything.

The idea started as a Christmas present for my girlfriend, who told me she really wanted fairy lights to put up in her room. Being me, I didn't want to just buy her standard Christmas lights and be done with it, so I decided to buy two strings of 50 addressable LEDs based off the WS2812 IC. I then wanted to build a circuit connected to a 16x2 display I had lying around, and program a menu into it so that she could change between a number of different preset modes, as well as have settings to dim the brightness and speed of LED change. All of this took quite a while to do next to my studies, but eventually I got it done and the picture on the tile for this project is actually the lights once they were put up in her room. They don't only do a single colour either, there are lots of different modes I programmed, such as rainbow, strobe, and my favourite, lava. All of these were driven through the FastLED library for Arduino.

I plan to write more and add more pictures to this soon, since this is the project I learned how to use EAGLE for schematics and then eventually home PCB etching to make the board for it.
