# Variable Power Supply

This is a project I am currently working on and waiting for supplies to come in for. I plan to take the power circuit from a DVD player I salvaged to power a variable buck converter that will step down the voltage to an adjustable level, as well as include a constant 5 volt output. All of this will be tied to a simple current and voltage display module I bought, to be able to accurately see what levels the power supply is outputting. This is an important tool for any workbench, and I figured instead of buying a super expensive one I'd rather learn about power conversion and build my own for cheaper. Schematics and other files coming soon as I continue my work on this project.
