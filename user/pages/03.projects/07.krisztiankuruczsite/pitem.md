# KrisztianKurucz.ca Website

My personal website has existed in some form or another for a couple of years now. It has become something I am proud of and excited to share with people. Web development has always been a side passion of mine, and I am happy with the point I've gotten this website to, as well as how my associated web development skills have grown as a result.

This site is built with a lightweight CMS called Grav, and is based on a Bootstrap theme called CleanBlog. I've since heavily modified many parts of it, and even had to port it over to become a Grav theme. In addition to all the web development, I set up the entire backend on my virtual private server running Ubuntu. I've used Apache in the past, but recently just to try something new I moved it all over to Nginx.

The source can be found over on GitHub, but I haven't gotten around to setting up any git hooks yet so be advised it might be an older version than what you see in your browser.
