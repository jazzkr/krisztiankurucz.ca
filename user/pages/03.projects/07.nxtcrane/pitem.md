# Lego NXT Crane

This is an autonomous crane that I build with a group of 4 for a project in my first semester in engineering. It used Lego for the frame and the NXT processor as the brains of the project. Our design was actually so ambitious that we had to link together two different NXTs through bluetooth to be able to connect all the required actuators and sensors we needed in order for it to function.

Its purpose was simply to scan with an ultrasonic sensor and find the nearest object to it, then bring that object back to its original position using its claw, keeping track of its position in space through encoders mounted on the motors. The code for the microprocessor was written in RobotC.
