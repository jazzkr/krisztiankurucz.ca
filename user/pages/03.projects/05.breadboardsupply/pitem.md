# Breadboard Power Supply

This is a quick and dirty 5 volt power supply I built for mounting on a breadboard. Soldering and wire connections don't look the best for sure, but for an afternoon of work I don't think it's too bad. Built this out of a need that arised when I was playing around with a simple car kit that I might do some future projects on. It takes in anywhere from 7 - 20 volts and the onboard LM7805 regulator steps it down to a steady 5 volts and 1.5 amps of current. Added some necessary passives to smooth things out, an LED to show its working, as well as an extra two pins that output the voltage of the wallwart you're using with it for some added flexibility. It's worked well enough for my purposes. When I get some time maybe I'll draw up a quick schematic for it and post it here.
