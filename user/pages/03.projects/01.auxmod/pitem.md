# Car Aux Modification

This is a project I worked on over my co-op term at Imagine, but I had been planning and researching it for a couple of months prior to that. The specific version of my car, a 2007 Audi A4, unfortunately did not come with any sort of aux input to play music from a phone or other device. I love listening to music while driving, and actually built up a fairly impressive collection of CDs for it (mostly for my roadtrip to the Gaspesie in Quebec in the summer of 2015), however, it was always fairly inconvenient whenever I discovered new music that I didn't have a CD of.

Some quick googling brought me to an Audi forum that let me know that the back of my stereo actually had aux inputs, with the only problem being that they were not enabled on my car's computer. Looking into it, enabling that input wasnt technically difficult, just a matter of buying an extremely expensive piece of proprietary equipment called a VAGCOM. Since I'm a student and didn't have much money to begin with, I instead opted to contact someone through an online services website, and basically pay them a much smaller amount of money to use their VAGCOM to enable aux input on my car. Once this was done, it was simply a matter of getting some good quality shielded stereo wire and wiring that to some pins that fit into the harness in the back of my stereo. For aesthetic purposes I bought a panel mount female stereo plug, drilled an appropriately sized hole into a piece of blank panel just above and to the right of my car's stereo to put it in, locked it in place with some epoxy, and wired everything up properly. The result looked like it came with the original car. Unfortunately I did have some problems with noise in the form of alternator whine, but I managed to clear that up with a ground loop isolator I later installed into the signal line.

Unfortunately I don't currently have a good picture of the result due to being off at school and not having access to my car, but I'll try to get one to post here soon!
