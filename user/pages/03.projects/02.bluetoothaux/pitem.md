# Modular Car Bluetooth

After finishing my car aux modification I talked about in a different project, I thought some more about how I could improve my existing setup. This resulted in me finding and buying a cheap little bluetooth board that had an aux input and output, and could be powered from anything between 4-24 volts. I wanted to put this into a some plastic housing I had lying around so that it would be convenient to use in my car. My thought process for powering this board was that I didn't want to route any messy wires from the internals of my car, so since I had a 4 port USB splitter already plugged in to charge my phone when I'm driving, I figured I could just use that to power this board as well. For that I soldered a microUSB female jack onto some protoboard, added an aux port, and even added a 5mm blue LED to see what state the board was in. I wired the board to all of these outputs, then put it all into the plastic housing and made sure it all fit. My only problem with the end result was the sloppy way I cut through the housing at the end to make sure the connectors were accessible. You can see a picture below:

Since then I have learned from this and adopted a new and much more precise and clean way to cut through plastic housing, as well as purchased some files to allow me to smooth the edges a lot more cleanly.

Regardless, the end result for such a quick and dirty project was quite satisfactory. The bluetooth board even added some needed amplification to the line, and everything works perfectly through bluetooth, cutting down on all the wires in the cabin. I could even hide the module in the glovebox and the wires leading to it are barely noticable.

_Update: I'm looking at reworking this project slightly and designing my own PCB to use for it, to be able to fit everything into a smaller form factor while gaining some more hardware design experience._
