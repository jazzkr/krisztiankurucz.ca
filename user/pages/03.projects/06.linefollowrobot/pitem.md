# Line Following Hall Effect Robot

This is a project we did for our Sensors and Instrumentations course, where we soldered SMD ICs and passives onto a printed PCB the lab provided us with to create a line following robot that stopped and blinked an LED depending on the magnetic field it was detecting at the time. We used an 8 bit PIC microprocessor that we programmed using C. My robot actually ended up passing the course perfectly the first time, so I achieved 100% for the lab portion of this course. It was definitely good getting some experience soldering tiny SMD components by hand, including the microprocessor, as well as interfacing and adjusting the output signal of the various different sensors we mounted on the board. We had to figure out all of the different op amp configurations and gains on our own before coming to the lab. It also included an IR emitter and sensor circuit that we had to setup ourselves (this is what the tile picture is for this project), that acted as an encoder for the wheels.
