# Wooden Storage Rack

This is a simple 3D model I drafted up and then created by hand out of wood. It is a wooden storage rack that my girlfriend actually wanted for storing nail polish. Not the most glamorous project by any means but I love taking any opportunity to use SolidWorks to create an accurate model, then recreating that in real life out of wood. I liked this project because it taught me a lot about working with my hands to create a final polished project. Definitely going to look for some more complex woodworking projects in the future to work on in my spare time. Unfortunately I could not find a picture of the final result, only the model, so I will work on finding and posting one soon.
