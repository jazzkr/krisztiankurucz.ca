# Github Reminder App

This is a cross-platform app I began work on in my spare time around February of 2016. Having discovered GitHub's Atom text editor, I learned a bit about AngularJS and some other powerful web technologies, and how they can now be used to build simple and sleek applications on Windows and Mac. Looking further into this I discovered Apache Cordova, Adobe PhoneGap, and the Ionic Frameworkf or creating cross-platform mobile apps. Having done some Android development in Java in the past, I realized how useful it could be to maintain a single codebase for a variety of different platforms. I decided since I wanted to start some sort of app project anyways, that I would use Ionic to create one thats cross-platform, while improving my Javascript and HTML skills at the same time.

The idea I came up with for an app was a simple GitHub streak reminder. I thought of this from seeing the GitHub contributions heatmap on my profile, and realizing how barren it is due to my lack of commits. An app that would remind me I have a streak going on would motivate me to commit at least something once a day, and that way all of my active coding projects would stay at the forefront of my thoughts and my GitHub would look much better as a result.

I have gotten the code to a point where I successfully scrape the data for a given user from GitHub, and show it as a heatmap courtesy of the cal-heatmap javascript plugin. As I've been developing this app I keep coming up with more and more ideas for future updates, so I'm really excited to continue working on it and building it out, even though development time is slowed since I'm learning AngularJS and all of these technologies as I go along.

Unfortunately, development has stalled a bit in the face of other projects and commitments I have, but I fully intend to return to this app soon and build it out into something simple I can release on Google Play and the iTunes app store.
